# ReconBlitz Design Document

## Overview
ReconBlitz is a Rust-based network reconnaissance tool that orchestrates multiple scanning tools to perform comprehensive network assessments.

## Architecture
The system is composed of the following modules:
  - `main.rs`: Entry point, handles command-line arguments and logging initialization.
  - `orchestrator.rs`: Manages the execution of scanning tools, including concurrency control and error handling.
  - `scanner.rs`: Contains the logic for individual scanning tools (e.g., RustScan, nmap).

### Data Flow
  1. The user invokes the tool with a target and optional parameters.
  2. The main module parses arguments and initializes logging.
  3. The orchestrator module coordinates the scanning tools, limiting concurrency and enforcing timeouts.
  4. The scanner module runs the specific tools and returns the results.
  5. The results are printed to the console and/or logged.

## Security
  - Input Validation: The target is validated and sanitized to prevent command injection.
  - Least Privilege: The Docker container runs as a non-root user.
  - Dependency Scanning: `cargo-audit` is run during the Docker build to detect vulnerable dependencies.
  - Timeouts: Each scan command has a configurable timeout to prevent hanging processes.

## Robustness
  - Concurrency Control: Limits the number of concurrent scans to avoid resource exhaustion.
  - Logging: File-based logging for diagnostics and auditing.

## Future Plans
  - Support for more scanning tools.
  - HTML report generation.
  - Integration with vulnerability databases.
