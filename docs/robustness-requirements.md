# Robustness Requirements

This document outlines the robustness requirements for `ReconBlitz`.

## 1. Graceful Error Handling

*   The application must not crash if an underlying scanning tool (e.g., `nmap`, `masscan`) fails or times out.
*   It should log the error from the failed tool and continue with the other tools in the profile.
*   The final report should clearly indicate which tools failed and why.

## 2. Comprehensive Input Validation

*   All user-provided inputs (target domains/IPs, profile names, etc.) must be strictly validated.
*   The application should provide clear, user-friendly error messages for invalid inputs.

## 3. Configurable Timeouts

*   Each external tool executed by `ReconBlitz` must have a configurable timeout.
*   There should be a default timeout that can be overridden by the user.

## 4. Efficient Resource Management

*   The application should manage system resources (CPU, memory) effectively, especially when running multiple scans in parallel.
*   We should set a reasonable limit on the number of concurrent processes to prevent system overload.

## 5. Detailed Logging

*   The application must produce detailed logs with different log levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, ERROR).
*   Logs should be written to a file for auditing and debugging purposes.
