# Security Requirements

This document outlines the security requirements for `ReconBlitz`.

## 1. Strict Input Sanitization

*   All user inputs must be rigorously sanitized to prevent command injection and other injection-style attacks.
*   We should use established libraries for parsing and validating inputs like domain names and IP addresses.

## 2. Principle of Least Privilege

*   The application should be designed to run with the minimum privileges necessary.
*   The Docker container should run as a non-root user by default.

## 3. Dependency Security

*   We must regularly scan our project's dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `cargo-audit`.
*   A process for updating vulnerable dependencies should be established.

## 4. Secure Defaults

*   The default scanning profiles should be designed to be safe and not overly aggressive.
*   The "stealth" profile should be carefully crafted to minimize detection.

## 5. Hardened Docker Image

*   The `Dockerfile` should be optimized to create a minimal, hardened image, reducing the potential attack surface.
*   This includes using a minimal base image and removing unnecessary tools and packages.
