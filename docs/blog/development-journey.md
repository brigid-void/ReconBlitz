# Developing ReconBlitz with AI Assistance

As a digital nomad traveling through the Pacific Northwest, I built ReconBlitz using:
- [Windsurf](https://windsurf.codes): AI pair programming assistant
- DeepSeek R1: Free open-source AI model
- Rust: For safety and performance

## Key Development Practices
1. **AI Pair Programming**: Used for rapid prototyping
2. **GitHub Actions**: Automated testing and releases
3. **Community-Driven**: Open source from day one

## AI-Assisted Specification Drafting

During the specification phase, I worked with Cascade (Windsurf's AI agent) to:
- Define technical requirements for RustScan integration
- Document robustness and security standards
- Create a consolidated specification document

This AI collaboration helped rapidly formalize requirements before implementation.
