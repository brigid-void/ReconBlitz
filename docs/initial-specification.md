# ReconBlitz Initial Specification

## 1. Overview
ReconBlitz is a Rust-based reconnaissance tool designed for security professionals, bug bounty hunters, and CTF players. This specification outlines the core requirements for the MVP release.

## 2. Core Features
- Profile-based scanning (`fast`, `full`, `stealth`)
- Tool orchestration (nmap, masscan, ffuf, amass, subfinder)
- Parallel execution with configurable timeouts
- Unified HTML/JSON reporting
- Docker support for isolated scanning

## 3. Performance Requirements
- Implement hybrid RustScan + nmap approach for port scanning
- All-port scan completion in < 3 seconds for `fast` profile
- Adaptive resource management to prevent system overload

## 4. Robustness Requirements
[See Robustness Requirements](./robustness-requirements.md)

## 5. Security Requirements
[See Security Requirements](./security-requirements.md)

## 6. RustScan Integration
[See RustScan Integration Plan](./feature-rustscan-integration.md)

## 7. Future Roadmap
- UX improvements for CLI
- Simplified launch command
- Native Rust implementations to replace external tools
- Cloud deployment enhancements

## 8. Target Audience
- Bug bounty hunters
- CTF participants
- Purple teamers
- Security researchers

## 9. Acceptance Criteria
- All robustness requirements implemented
- Security requirements met
- RustScan integration functional
- Performance targets achieved for all profiles
